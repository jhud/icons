# Icons
Minimal, modern UI icons with a unified theme.

These were created by James Hudson with Inkscape as a set of unobtrusive, generic icons to use in a wide range of software projects.

I'm sharing these in case anyone else needs a set of commonly-used icons to get their project up and running quickly.
